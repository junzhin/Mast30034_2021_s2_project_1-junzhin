# Other
- Run notebooks in the listed order above and ensure you have run the notebook 0 to download the raw data beforehand.
- Make sure to change the filepath to your local machine if you intend to run the codes above under a different environment.
- Changing filepath is just to chang first disk name,and the rest are the same.
- To sucessfully run the notebooks,you must change all filepaths in notebooks
- Some plots are not saved by notebook auto-generation and they are saved through manual screenshot, but they are all there, if you are in doubt, check them out!
